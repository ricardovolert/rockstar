v0.99 (3/19/2012):
*) Updated the unbinding calculation to use physical velocities instead of peculiar velocities.
*) Improved network layer now supports transparent auto-healing in case of connection failures and better rejection of non-Rockstar connections.
*) No lower boxsize limit for non-periodic boundary conditions.
*) A utility for calculating host-subhalo relationships is now included (see README).
*) Included example source code for reading the particle output formats (see examples/).

v0.98.5 (1/10/2012):
*) Fixed an important issue with calculating Vrms: previously, it was calculated using all particles associated to the halo, instead of just those within the halo radius R_delta (thanks to Michael Busha for catching this).
*) Added support for easy restarting of Rockstar if it terminates in the middle of a run for any reason.  (See restart.cfg in README).
*) Added support for specifying the GADGET halo particle type (if it is not the default, 1).
*) Support for the undocumented "GADGET_INTERNAL" format was removed.
*) Added missing support for auto server port when server address is specified.

v0.98 (12/27/2011):
*) Increased the speed of boundary checks; the particle distribution stage is now more efficient.
*) Fixed an issue whereby duplicate halos could be output in merger trees; this only appears on certain versions of Linux when there are very few halos per processor (thanks to Markus Haider for finding this!).
*) Fixed two issues where calculating the position and velocity variance of particle groups would in hang in rare instances (Thanks to Michael Busha for finding the first of these!).
*) Fixed a mistake in the IO code which prevented TIPSY support from working (Thanks to Michael Busha for catching this!).
*) Updated the readme to be clearer about how to run Rockstar in master/client mode.

v0.97.1:
*) Added support for user-configurable load-balancing.

v0.97 (11/1/2011):
*) Fixed a race condition which was halting execution for snapshots without any halos.
*) Included config files to run on the Ranger machine at TACC.
*) Added YT support (from Matt Turk).
*) Added initial/alpha support for reading TIPSY files (from Greg Stinson).

v0.96.2 (10/20/2011):
Initial public release
